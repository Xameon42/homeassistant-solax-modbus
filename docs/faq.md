# FAQ

## I have a question that is not answered here

Always also check vendor specific FAQ pages:

- [SolaX Power](solax-faq.md)
- [Sofar Solar](sofar-faq.md)


## Produce a debug log file with startup info
When reporting an issue, we recommend or may ask you to attach a debug log that includes a HA restart.
Not only the error messages are of interest, but also the information on how blocks are composed and read may be needed to resolve an issue.
The easiest way to temporarily enable debug loggging is:
- go to Settings -> Devices and services
- Select the Solax Modbus integration
- In the right corner aboven you will find a dropdown that allows you to enable debug logging: <img width="2358" height="742" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6089849-5671-46ec-b875-552b8ca1591c" />
- Restart HA (e.g. by going to Developer Tools > -> YAML tab -> Restart
- Give HA sufficient time to restart and wait until all services are loaded. _Please make sure you wait long enough to catch sufficient logs (minimum 2 minutes)_
- Go back to the Settings -> Devices and Services -> Solax modbus page and disable debug logging
- You will now have the option to download the debug log file

For the paranoid:
 - It is unlikely but not impossible that the log file contains lines generated by other integrations that you consider confidential.
For this integration, only the serial number could be considered a bit sensitive.
Be careful when you remove lines for confidentiality reasons, make sure they are not related to this integration. 
The line(s) with the serial number should not be removed, but you can replace the last digits by XXXXX. 
Alternatively, you can send the unmodified logfile in a private message to the developer that requested the logfile.

In case you forget to disable debug mode, the system will automatically disable it after a while (at next restart ?)




## Detailed Log - alternative way (in case the integration cannot even be installed)
[![Open your Home Assistant instance and display logs.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/logs.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/logs/)

Settings → System → Logs > dropdown at top right corner > “LOAD FULL LOGS”
Now the full logs are loaded. If you scroll down, you will see them. Once the full logs are shown, you can either use the search function in your browser to search for “solax” related entries or use the search entry field on top of the page.
Search for solax and report us the logs. Make sure to replace sensitive information by xxxx (if any)

If the log doesn't return anything useful add the following to your `configuration.yaml`
```
logger:
  default: info
```
You could also chose debug instead of info, but don't forget to disable debug mode again.

## Detected blocking call

This issue is resolved in the 2024.02.6 version of the integration. Please update.

## Donations / Sponsor

Please don't use / expect Donations as a form of paid technical support.

I was asked to add the option to recieve donations as people wanted to buy me a Beer/Cola or multiples as a form of thanks.

## Entity I need is not present

Your desired entity is most likely disabled. Example given is for "Config Max Export"

- Go to the SolaX Integration page.
- Find "+xy entities not shown"
- Click those till you find "Config Max Export"
- Then Cog/Gear icon.
- There is an option to enable it and press "UPDATE"

## How to check a version of a python module e.g. pyModbus

- Virtual Machine - Goto the console:

```
   ha > login
   # docker exec -it homeassistant /bin/bash
   pip show pymodbus
```
   
- Docker (Core) - Goto the console:

```
   pip show pymodbus
```

To list all modules:

```
   Replace:
   pip show pymodbus
   With:
   pip list
```

## Unable to control Inverter when PV = 0 & Battery SOC is at Minimum

This isn't a fault with the Integration.
PV and Hybrid Inverters are designed to produce electricity and not consume.

- PV Inverter's when PV = 0 they shut down.
- Hybrid Inverter's when PV = 0 and Battery reaches Minimum SOC they shut down.

If you want to charge during the night you need to set a charge Window before the Hybrid Inverter shuts down.

## Unrecognized XYZ inverter type - serial number : unknown

If you get **unrecognized XYZ inverter type - serial number : unknown** you don't have a working Modbus connection.
Don't raise an issue, this isn't a fault of the Integration.
Either use one of the [existing discussions](https://github.com/wills106/homeassistant-solax-modbus/discussions?discussions_q=%22Unrecognized+Inverter%22) or start a new one to understand how to communicate with your Inverter.
